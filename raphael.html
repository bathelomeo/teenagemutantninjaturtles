        <em>
            Raphael is the Turtle who is best known for his hair-trigger temper.
            Which are present in almost all incarnations of the character.
            He is characterized by a red headband.
            Also being the only one of the four turtles to wear it.
            In all forms of media.
            While he's fiercely loyal to his brothers.
            He's also often the one giving them a hard time.
            Raphael is also the one most likely to strike out on his own.
            When he feels slighted or underappreciated.
            His closest animal friend was his pet turtle.
            Knowing the world would be dangerous and there would be a time where they want to explore the outside world, Splinter trained the boys in the art of Ninjitsu. Leo and his brothers were named after great Renaissance artists from a book Splinter fished out of the storm drain. <strong>Info From Wiki Fandom</strong>
