            Leonardo is named after Leonardo da vin ci <strong>I think so</strong>.
            Leonardo is a leader.
            Leonardo is a good ninja.
            He destroyed shreder.
            Leonardo has four brothers.
            Leonardo is the oldest turtle of them all.
            He is the most ordered.
            He has the most diciplined of the turtles.
            He possesses a very strong bond with his father/mentor Splinter.
            He is often depicted wearing a blue bandana.
            Leo's greatest source of frustration is being team leader.
            He's the most driven of the four Turtles.
            In the end, the Kraang dropped the canister of Mutagen they were holding, causing the turtles and Yoshi to mutate. Yoshi, having to have stepped on that rat, thus mutated into a humanoid brown rat by the name of "Splinter", while Leo and his brothers, after coming in contact with Splinter when he was human, mutated into humanoid turtles. Splinter knew they would never be accepted in their urban society, so he took them to the sewers, made a home down there, and made the four turtles his children.<strong>Info From Wiki Fandom</strong>
