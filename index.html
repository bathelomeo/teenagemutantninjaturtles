        <p>
        <em>
            Leonardo is named after the artist leonardo.
            Leonardo is the leader.
            The leader ot the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
            He is the leader because he asked to be.
The leader of the Turtles, Leonardo aspires to be a brave, decisive, perfect hero. Unfortunately, he's an inexperienced teen (for the moment at least) with three smart-aleck brothers. It's the gap between his aspiration and current situation that is the greatest source of frustration in Leo's life. He's the most driven of the four Turtles, training and studying relentlessly. He tends to be hard on himself, but his diligence does not go unnoticed; he is the favored student of Splinter, whose approval he very much craves.<strong>Info From Wiki Fandom </strong>
