            Mikey is usually shortened to mikey.
            He is one of the main protagonists of the 2012 television series.
            He is the adoptive son of Master Splinter.
            Who was before Hamato Yoshi
            The adoptive brother of Karai/Hamato Miwa.
            Mikey does not say his famous "Cowabunga" catchphrase.
            Instead he mainly says BOOYAKASHA.
            He usually says this when accomplishing something or attacking an enemy.
            He wears an orange mask.
            He fights with two nunchakus.
            Which can be converted into kusarigama.
            He has a thousand ideas, and every now and then, one of them will be brilliant. This combination of creativity and lack of focus gives him a kind of "flow" that the other Turtles cannot match. He's a social mutant and more than the others, pines to be part of the real world. <strong>Info From Wiki Fandom</strong>

         Mikey is known as the the "wild one" of the team.
            Mikey is also the cool one.
            And the chill one.
            And he is a lover of games.
            He likes skateboarding.
            Mikey is shorter than his brothers.
            Way shorter than Donatello.
            Mikey also seems to be a little pudgier than his brothers. 
            The animators gave Mikey baby blue eyes to make him look slightly more innocent.
            However, like all of the Turtles when they're in combat, the pupils and irises vanish from his eyes
